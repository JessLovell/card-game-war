    <h2>HOW TO PLAY WAR</h2>
    <p>The goal is to win as many hands as possible per set of 52 cards<br><br>

        <b><u>THE DEAL</u></b><br> The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards. Each player is dealt automatically. You the player are the yellow deck. Your enemy is the Purple deck.<br><br>

        <b><u>THE PLAY</u></b><br> You the Player clicks your yellow deck to flip the cards and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, in their win pile.<br><br> If the cards are the same value, it is War. Each player
        flips three cards face down and one card face up. The player with the higher card takes both piles. If you have less that five cards you place as many cards face down as you can while leaving one to flip face up.<br><br>

        <b><u>HOW TO KEEP SCORE</u></b><br> The set ends when you exhaust all the cards in the play deck. Whoever has more cards in their hold pile wins. If the two hold piles are the same you have a rematch. The game then restarts and you play until you have gone through all of the sets you selected. The overall winner is then declared based on how many sets have been won.</p>
