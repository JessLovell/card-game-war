PROJECT NAME: War, the Card Game

PROJECT TEAM: Jessica Lovell, David Muench, Patrick McNamee, George McCadden the III

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: A standard deck of 52 cards is shuffled and split between two equal stacks which are then split between the user and the computer. Then each player turns over the top card of their stacks and the player with the higher rank card “wins” and gets to take the two cards and place them at the bottom of their stack. If the cards end up being the same rank, then a “war” occurs. The players each deal three cards face down. They then each deal a face up card and the player with the higher rank of these cards wins. If the ranks are the same, then another war ensues. If at any time during a war, a player runs out of cards, then the last card they can play is used as the face up card for the war. The goal is to be the person who ends up with most cards.
